# bad_raycaster
A little raycaster in webgl 2, the basis of 2.5 games like wolfestein 3d.

### Tecnologies used
- Webgl 2, used to display stuff onto the screen, essentially the same as opengl.
- Typescript, pretty cool language, not my favourite, but better than js
- Escript, pretty cool, super lightweight and easy to use, much better than Vite
### How to run
**The site is online**, but if you want to run it locally, just
```bash
git clone https://github.com/fantasyAlgo/webglRaycaster.git
cd webglRaycaster
# To run it, you can double click on the html file, or
npm install -g live-server # If you don't have it already installed
live-server
```
### How to use it
There are two modes in this project, you can switch between them using 'space'
- The first is the map viewed as 'above', with the rays displayed
- The other one is the raycasted one, that is, the 2.5 dimensional view.
